I had a more modern website once. I didn't use it, and I didn't like it. The number of layers of abstraction and technologies between my _markdown_ and the final product was unbearable.

So I decided to switch to the most minimal setup I could get away with. I'm using `pandoc` to convert the _markdown_ files into _html_, using the standard template with minor additions. Now I just need to run a single bash script to generate the whole website, and I feel much better.

Notably, this website does not use any _javascript_ and it never will.

The structure and ""code"" of the website can be found on the [github repository](https://github.com/BayoDev/bayodev.github.io) where its hosted using [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
